#  Day 1: Creating a Pet Object in JavaScript

##  Objective
To learn how to create and interact with JavaScript objects by building a pet with properties and methods. This reinforces object-oriented programming concepts.

##  What I Built
- A `pet` object with the following properties:
  - `name`: The pet's name
  - `species`: The type of pet (e.g., Dog, Cat)
  - `happiness`: Starts at 50
- Methods to interact with the pet:
  - `play()`: Increases happiness by 10
  - `feed()`: Increases happiness by 20
  - `status()`: Displays current pet details
  - `rename(newName)` (Bonus): Changes the pet’s name

##  Files Included
- `index.js` – JavaScript file containing the pet object and all method calls
