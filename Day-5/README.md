# Follow-Up Assignment: Managing Pet Energy and Happiness

##  Objective
The goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of **JavaScript loops** and **conditionals** by managing the energy and happiness of pets in a pet kennel. Through playing and feeding pets, you will practice updating properties dynamically, creating more engaging and interactive behavior for the pets.

##  What I Built
- Updated the **`play()`** method of the pet objects to:
  - Increase happiness by 10.
  - Decrease energy by 15.
  - Return a message like: `"You played with Fluffy! Happiness is now 60, Energy is now 85."`

- **Played with Pets**:
  - Played with some pets more than others, such as playing with the first pet three times and the second pet once.
  - Used a **`for` loop** and **random number generator** to randomly feed pets (Bonus task).

- **Feed Pets Conditionally**:
  - Implemented a **`for` loop** to iterate through each kennel (dogKennel, catKennel, fishTank).
  - If a pet’s energy is below 30, it’s fed using the **`feed()`** method, which increases both happiness and energy.
  - After feeding, the updated status of the pet is logged.
